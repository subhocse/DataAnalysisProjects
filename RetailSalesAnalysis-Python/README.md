# Retail Sales Analysis with Python

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using Python. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from sales datasets.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `RetailSalesAnalysis-Python/`
  - `RetailSalesAnalysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
  - `data/` – Directory for datasets used in the analysis.
  - `images/` – Directory containing visualizations generated during EDA.
  - `README.md` – Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Features

- **Data Loading**: Import retail sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate descriptive statistics and identify trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots to visualize sales patterns and customer behavior.
- **Insights Generation**: Derive actionable insights to inform business decisions.

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subhocse/DataAnalysisProjects.git
   cd DataAnalysisProjects/RetailSalesAnalysis-Python
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure the following packages are installed:*

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `RetailSalesAnalysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

## 📈 Usage

The Jupyter Notebook `RetailSalesAnalysis.ipynb` guides you through the entire analysis process:

1. **Data Import**: Load the retail sales dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and format inconsistencies.
3. **EDA**: Explore data distributions, correlations, and trends.
4. **Visualization**: Generate plots to illustrate key findings.
5. **Insights**: Summarize observations and potential business implications.

## 📂 Datasets

Datasets used in this analysis are located in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the necessary CSV files are present before running the notebook.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

Visual outputs generated during the analysis are saved in the `images/` directory. These include bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and more to support the findings.
